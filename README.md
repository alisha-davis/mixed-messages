# mixed-messages: random message generator
### Codecademy Portfolio Project: Mixed Messages (JavaScript)  
A random message generator program which gives the user a suggested vacation. The output is made up of four different pieces of data: 
- destination 
- accomodation type 
- activity
- duration  

The first three components are randomised from given arrays, whilst the latter is a random number of nights (up to a week). Together, they combine into one string for the output.

#### Original brief:   
*For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.*
